# FrameX-Modding
Modding FrameX to customize
## Problem:
We have extracted the JSON structure from the FrameX APK, but the format is inconsistent. We need help parsing the data and modifying it.

## What Weâ€™ve Done:
âœ… Decompiled APK using Apktool  
âœ… Identified the JSON file in `/assets/`  
âœ… Attempted modification, but recompilation fails  

## Help Needed:
- Parsing JSON structure  
- Fixing recompile issues  
- Signing and installing APK
